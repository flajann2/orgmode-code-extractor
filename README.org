* orgmode-code-extractor
** Introduction
  Orgmode-code-extractor takes as a parameter your orgmode file,
  and optionally a target directory, and will
  spit out the extracted code in your code blocks using the name of 
  #+BEGIN_SRC orgmode
    #+name:
  #+END_SRC
  
  with the extension of the first word following the #+BEGIN_SRC.
  For example, if you have in your org file:
  #+BEGIN_SRC orgmode
    # +name: Creepy.people
    # +BEGIN_SRC javascript
      {
        "name": "Herman Munster",
        "address": "2121 Mockingbird Lane"
      }
    # +END_SRC
  #+END_SRC
  Then a file with the name of "Creepy.people.javascript" with the contents of:
  #+name: sample.stuff
  #+BEGIN_SRC javascript
      {
        "name": "Herman Munster",
        "address": "2121 Mockingbird Lane"
      }
  #+END_SRC
  will be created.
** Installation
   Installation is accomplished by doing:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     gem install orgmode-code-extractor
   #+END_SRC

** Usage
   By default, orgmode-code-extractor will attempt to write the
   output to a "./oce" directory, which must be present or it
   will fail. You can specify your own target directory or
   just create the "./oce" one in your current directory. To get
   more information on how you can specify your own, type:
   #+BEGIN_SRC commandline
     orgmode-code-extractor help extract
   #+END_SRC
   at the commandline.

   To run this on your orgmode files,
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     orgmode-code-extractor extract yourfile1.org yourfile2.org ...
   #+END_SRC
   and it will create the extractions nicely.

** Motivation behind this project
   There are many ways to actually excute orgmode code blocks, but in my
   case, I am using orgmode to document a JSON api. There was no clean way
   availabe at the time to extract these nicely, so I wrote this tool. Just
   a few lines of code that saved my sanity.
   
   You will also note that this document is itself an orgmode file, which
   was used to test the orgmode-code-extractor. Yes, I eat my own dog food. lol

** Contributing to orgmode-code-extractor
   Your contributions are more than welcome, as this was something I threw together
   quicky in just a couple of hours. It could use better error handling and many other
   options I did not have the time to throw in. So just the usual branching and pull 
   request bit as outlined below!

+ Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
+ Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
+ Fork the project.
+ Start a feature/bugfix branch.
+ Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
+ Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
+ Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
